~ V2.2-stable
[New]
• Added supported governor detector for fallbacks if powersave doesn't existed

[Fixed issues]

[Optimization & Improvement]
• Use more-efficient property checks instead of getprop to reduce overhead
• Improved compatibility for exynos devices
• Minor code cleanup

~ V2.1-stable
• Forcing to override governor permissions from read-only to read/write (this fixes was created due to encore tweaks module causing governor to be read-only)
• Reuses .join() paths once.
• Safer name extraction with let Some(...) = to avoid hidden bugs.
• Less .trim() redundancy (some min/max could include newline).
• Avoid unnecessary .clone() on Option<String>
• Minor code logic improvement and optimization

~ V2.0-stable
• Improved inotify mechanism

• Dynamically change inotify buffer if inotify overflow was detected
• Reduce polling loop for property to 4s
• Sleep 2s and retries if inotify error
• Avoid Unused Cow<'static, str>
• Reduced potential minor memory deduplication for screen state and governor string
• Use Atomic for Bool State to Reduce locking overhead
• Improved getprop function efficiency
• Avoid .to_string() in default closure
• [Inotify] Clamp the buffer_size growth to prevent it growing indefinitely
• Offloading some logic into a background thread
• Significantly Improved compatibility across all devices

~ V1.9-stable
• Increases loop time to 5s to reduce overhead (also to reduce constantly checking debug.laya.battmon_enabled prop)
• Improved log message clarity

• Major refactor code & further code optimizations

~ V1.8-stable
• Refine code for better stability and lower overhead
• Remove static load defaults function to reduce overhead
• Dynamically saves the current frequencies & governor right before screen locked (alternative of static load defaults)
• Restore cpu freqs/governor completely if debug.laya.battmon_enabled value was 0
• Fix schedutil or other folder detected as cpu policy
• Sleep 30s after sys.boot_complete=1 for stability reason
• Code improvement & misc optimizations

~ V1.7-stable
• Optimized looping logic
• Improved apply & restore CPU freq / governor logic
• Set to powersave governor when screen off and restore governor back to normal when screen on
• Loop every 0.5s while screen off to prevent sudden lag (doesn't apply when the screen is on to avoid overhead)
• Removed unused sugov_ext governor constant
• Added Dynamic feature toggle (you can disable the battmon thread if needed through property)
• Reduced power consumption even more and heat control during screen off
• Minor code improvement & optimization
