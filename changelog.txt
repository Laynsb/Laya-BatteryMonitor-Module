### These changelog are meant for BatteryMonitor-dev GitHub
# For developers, Visit https://github.com/Laynsb/Laya-BatteryMonitor

~ V1.9-stable
• Increases loop time to 5s to reduce overhead (also to reduce constantly checking debug.laya.battmon_enabled prop)
• Improved log message clarity
• Added build metadata (Advanced build date)
• Major refactor code & further code optimizations

~ V1.8-stable
• Refine code for better stability and lower overhead
• Remove static load defaults function to reduce overhead
• Dynamically saves the current frequencies & governor right before screen locked (alternative of static load defaults)
• Restore cpu freqs/governor completely if debug.laya.battmon_enabled value was 0
• Fix schedutil or other folder detected as cpu policy
• Sleep 30s after sys.boot_complete=1 for stability reason
• Code improvement & misc optimizations

~ V1.7.3-stable
• Improved log accuracy

~ V1.7.2-stable
• Optimized in-memory map logic
• Fixed init ownership (changed to system:system)

~ V1.7.1-stable
• Optimized apply CPU Freq/gov logic
• [logic] Added fallback to scaling_min_freq if cpuinfo_min_freq shows an error or abnormalities
• Updated readme.txt

~ V1.7-stable
• Optimized looping logic
• Improved apply & restore CPU freq / governor logic
• Set to powersave governor when screen off and restore governor back to normal when screen on
• Loop every 0.5s while screen off to prevent sudden lag (doesn't apply when the screen is on to avoid overhead)
• Removed unused sugov_ext governor constant
• Added Dynamic feature toggle (you can disable the battmon thread if needed through property)
• Reduced power consumption even more and heat control during screen off
• Minor code improvement & optimization
